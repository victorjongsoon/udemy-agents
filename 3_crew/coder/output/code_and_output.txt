```python
# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series and multiply the sum by 4

# Initialize the sum
sum_series = 0

# Calculate the sum of the first 10,000 terms
for n in range(10000):
    term = ((-1) ** n) / (2 * n + 1)  # Generate the term
    sum_series += term  # Add the term to the sum

# Multiply the total by 4
final_result = sum_series * 4

# Print the output
print(final_result)
```
